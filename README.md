### help

If you need help with understanding HTML or feel like getting ambitious here are some resources that should help. I highly recommend you using these resources should you run into any questions or feel like experiementing.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - Documentation for HTML. This will be your best friend whenever you need help.

- [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8BoXcpCUvdmdPZFuR5y2lV) - If you're more of a visual learner or just want more resources this link takes you to 
a helpful playlist for HTML but honestly the whole channel is a goldmine of knowledge.
